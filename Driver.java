// Joe Vassallo Final CS110 Minesweeper Project
// I got a bit carried away and did all the extra credits to be safe :)

/** EXTRA CREDIT CONSIDERATION
    I have added the following functionality, I would like to be evaluated for extra credit.
        ** First selection canâ€™t be a mine. 
        ** Throw an exception when the user attempts to uncover a flagged square.
        ** Allow the user to select a level when they start.
        ** Allow the user to restart the game.
        ** Early submission.
        ** Use recursion and implement the true game of Minesweeper.
